# The deterministic half of the commit-hygiene gate: a PR lands as ONE commit
# unless it explicitly opts out. Message format (type allowlist + mandatory
# scope) is the other half and belongs to commitlint-rs — see .commitlintrc.yml
# and `just commit-lint`.
#
# Only this one rule lives here, because the others are already covered:
#   • fixup!/squash! commits do not parse as Conventional Commits, so
#     commitlint rejects them — including under the override.
#   • fixup!/squash! are commitlint's problem, as above.
#
# Two rules live here, both about the shape of the branch:
#   1. the one-commit cap, liftable with the override token;
#   2. no merge commits, NOT liftable — see check_no_merges.
#
# The ruleset's `required_linear_history` keeps merge commits off main, but it
# says nothing about the branch, and GitHub's "Update branch" button defaults
# to merging the base in. There is no repository setting that changes that
# default or removes the option, so the only place to catch it is here.
#
# Configuration (environment variables, with defaults):
#   BASE_REF        base to diff against            (default: origin/main)
#   PR_BODY         PR description, for the override (default: empty)
#   MAX_COMMITS     commit-count cap                (default: 1)
#   OVERRIDE_TOKEN  phrase in PR_BODY that lifts the cap
#                                                   (default: allow-many-commits)
#
# The file is safe to `source` (for unit testing): it defines functions and
# only runs `main` when executed directly.
