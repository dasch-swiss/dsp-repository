# Button

Interactive button component for user actions.

## Usage Guidelines

Use buttons to trigger actions, submit forms, or navigate to different sections of the application. Choose the appropriate variant based on the action's importance and context.

## Variants

### Primary
The primary button is used for the most important action on a page. Use sparingly - typically only one primary button per page or section.

### Secondary
Secondary buttons are used for less important actions that still need emphasis. They can be used multiple times on a page.

### Outline
Outline buttons are used for tertiary actions or when you need a lighter visual treatment while maintaining accessibility.

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ Functional but incomplete - styling verification needed, missing accessibility features

## Design Notes

The button component follows Carbon Design System patterns with DSP brand customizations. Spacing and typography align with the design system tokens.

### Button vs. Link

Use buttons for actions that trigger changes or submit data. Use links for navigation to other pages or sections. Buttons should not be used for navigation purposes.
