# Tile

Tile component with base and clickable variants for content containers.

## Usage Guidelines

Use tiles to group related content in a visually distinct container. Choose the clickable variant when the entire tile should be interactive.

## Variants

### Base
Static content container for displaying information without interaction.

### Clickable
Interactive tile that responds to user interaction. Use when the entire tile should be clickable.

## Accessibility Notes

- Proper semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support for clickable variant
- Clear focus indicators
- Screen reader compatible content structure

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ Functional but incomplete - styling verification needed, missing accessibility features

## Design Notes

The tile component serves as a content container accepting arbitrary Markup. Custom test IDs are supported for testing. The clickable variant includes proper interaction states and accessibility features.
