# DSP Design System

## Introduction

The DSP Design System is a customization of the [IBM Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/). 
It follows Carbon in terms of design language and implementation. 
It is customized in the following ways:

- It is not a general purpose design system, but a purpose-built system. As such, it is much smaller and less complex.
- It is not generic or customizeable, instead the DSP brand is baked into it, thus simplifying complexity if use.
- It is purposefully kept small:
  - It comes with two themes (dark and light, corresponding to "gray-90" and "gray-10" in Carbon) 
    and no option for custom theming.
  - The set of available styles (colors, typography, spacing, etc.) 
    is kept intentionally small to promote consistent user interfaces.
  - It only has the components that are strictly needed.
    Additional components may be added, when necessary.
  - It only has the component variants that are strictly needed. 
    Additional component variants may be added, when necessary.
- It may have purpose-specific components. 
  (E.g. Carbon does not provide a "Card" component, but rather a "Tile" component, from which cards can be built. 
  The DSP Design System instead would provide a "Card" component.)


> [!NOTE]
> The DSP Design System is still in planning and not yet implemented.
