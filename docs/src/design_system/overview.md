# DSP Design System

## Introduction

The DSP Design System is a customization of the [IBM Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/). 
It follows Carbon in terms of design language and implementation. 
It is customized in the following ways:

- It is not a general purpose design system, but a purpose-built system. As such, it is much smaller and less complex.
- It is not generic or customizeable, instead the DSP brand is baked into it, thus simplifying complexity if use.
- It is purposefully kept small:
  - It comes with two themes (dark and light, corresponding to "gray-90" and "gray-10" in Carbon) 
    and no option for custom theming.
  - The set of available styles (colors, typography, spacing, etc.) 
    is kept intentionally small to promote consistent user interfaces.
  - It only has the components that are strictly needed.
    Additional components may be added, when necessary.
  - It only has the component variants that are strictly needed. 
    Additional component variants may be added, when necessary.
- It may have purpose-specific components. 
  (E.g. Carbon does not provide a "Card" component, but rather a "Tile" component, from which cards can be built. 
  The DSP Design System instead would provide a "Card" component.)


# Current Implementation Status

The DSP Design System is currently in early development with the following components implemented:

## Available Components

### Button
- **Implementation**: Native Maud
- **Variants**: Primary, Secondary, Outline
- **Status**: ðŸš§ Functional but incomplete (styling verification needed, missing accessibility features)
- **Features**: Basic button functionality with variant support, disabled state, custom test IDs

### Banner  
- **Implementation**: Native Maud
- **Variants**: Accent only, with prefix, with suffix, full (prefix + accent + suffix)
- **Status**: âœ… Fully functional
- **Features**: Semantic HTML with proper structure, configurable text sections with accent styling

### Shell
- **Implementation**: Carbon Web Components (CDN-based)
- **Purpose**: Application navigation and layout wrapper
- **Status**: âœ… Fully functional with advanced features
- **Features**: Responsive navigation header, search functionality, theme toggle with persistence, side navigation, accessible ARIA labels

### Tile
- **Implementation**: Native Maud
- **Variants**: Base, Clickable
- **Status**: ðŸš§ Functional but incomplete (styling verification needed, missing accessibility features)
- **Features**: Content containers accepting arbitrary Markup, custom test IDs

### Link
- **Implementation**: Carbon Web Components (CDN-based)
- **Purpose**: Navigation and external links
- **Status**: âœ… Functional (temporary implementation)
- **Features**: Carbon-styled links with brand colors and hover states

### Tag
- **Implementation**: Carbon Web Components (CDN-based)
- **Variants**: Gray, Blue, Green
- **Status**: ðŸš§ Functional but incomplete (missing variants and attributes)
- **Features**: Colored labels with brand-aligned styling, dynamic script loading

## Development Environment

### Playground
- **URL**: http://localhost:3400 (via `just run-watch-playground`)

  - **Component Isolation**: Iframe-based component rendering with parameter controls
  - **Variant Selection**: Dynamic component variant switching with real-time updates
  - **Theme Switching**: Light/dark theme toggle with live preview
  - **Documentation Tabs**: Component and documentation view switching
  - **Live Reload**: WebSocket-based automatic refresh on file changes
- **Testing**: Comprehensive TypeScript/Playwright test suite with functional, accessibility, responsive, and visual regression tests
- **Commands**: 
  - `just playground install` - Install frontend dependencies and browsers
  - `just playground test` - Run all automated tests
  - `just playground test-visual` - Run visual regression tests
  - `just playground test-headed` - Run tests with browser visible
