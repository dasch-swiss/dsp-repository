# Discovery, Design and Development Process

Any work on the DSP Repository is done in collaboration between 
Management, Product Management (PM), the Research Data Unit (RDU) and Development (Dev).
The process should look as outlined below,
but may be adjusted to fit the needs of the project and the team.

In discovery, PM validates that an opportunity is aligned with DaSCH's strategy.
In collaboration with the RDU, PM verifies that the opportunity can provide a desirable outcome.

PM will create a project description, including low-fidelity wireframes (Balsamiq or pen and paper), 
based on which they define user flows and journeys.

If any design components are needed, these will be added to the design system.

Finally, high-fidelity wireframes will be created in Figma, if needed.

Based on the project description and the wireframes,
Dev will refine the project description, create Linear tickets and implement it accordingly.

When the implementation is done, PM will verify that the outcome was achieved
and identify opportunities for further improvements.
