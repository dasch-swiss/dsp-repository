# Introduction

This is the monorepo for the DSP Repository.

The DaSCH Service Platform (DSP) consists of two main components:
- **DSP VRE**: The DSP Virtual Research Environment (VRE), 
  where resdearchers can work on their data during the lifetime of the project.
  It consists of the DSP-APP, DSP-API and DSP-TOOLS.  
  The DSP VRE is developed in various other git repositories.
- **DSP Repository**: The DSP Repository is the long-term archive for research data.
  It consists of the DSP Archive and the Discovery and Presentation Environment (DPE).  
  The DSP Repository is developed in this monorepo.

Additionally, the monorepo contains the DSP Design System and DaSCH's website.
