# Project Structure and Code Organization

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the DSP Repository. 
It is structured as a Rust workspace, with multiple crates.

All Rust crates are organized as subdirectories within the `modules/` directory.

Additionally, any non-Rust code or assets are placed either in the `assets/` directory
or as a separate module within the `modules/` directory.
