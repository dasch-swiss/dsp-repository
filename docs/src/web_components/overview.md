# Web Components Overview

DaSCH publishes a small number of purpose-built web components.
These components are intended for external use, allowing developers to integrate them into their own applications.

We do not publish our design system components as web components.

Web components are organized by functionality in the `web_components/` directory.

## Web Components

`attribution`:  
A badge component that external data providers can use to attribute their data if it is hosted on DaSCH.
