        "en": "Gustave Roud’s work includes several volumes of poetic prose, diary notes, translations, as well as  texts on literature and fine arts. The first critical edition of the poet will be published in two complementary formats: in several volumes, with the publisher Zoé (Carouge-Geneva) and, at the same time, on a digital platform. This platform will constitute the genetic accompaniment of the publication: it will host the digital facsimiles of Gustave Roud’s archive, which includes manuscripts and printed materials.\n\nIn these two formats the publication will enhance the exposure of one of the most important works of the 20th century Swiss literature and it will stimulate studies that respond to contemporary critical orientations: ecocriticism, literary geography and landscape studies, intermediality studies, and queer studies. Furthermore, the digital facsimiles of the archival materials will give the project a strong interdisciplinary dimension: taking into account the diversity of Roud’s practices – diary, poetry, photography, art criticism, literary criticism, translation – it will inspire a renewal of the approach to the work and to its author for the academic as well as the general public."
