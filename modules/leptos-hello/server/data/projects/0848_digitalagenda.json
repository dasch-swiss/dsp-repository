        "en": "The adoption of information and communications technologies (ICTs) within public schooling, higher education, and vocational education and training has been widely acknowledged as a major challenge. The Education and the European Digital Agenda project aims to document how this challenge was confronted in Europe during the initial decades following the emergence of microchip technology, which fundamentally transformed businesses, public administration, and daily life. \n\nThe database reconstructs the responses of policymakers and other relevant stakeholders in Germany (both the GDR and the FRG until 1990, and the unified German state from then onwards), Switzerland, and Sweden, as well as other international organisations such as EC/EU and UNESCO, to the educational challenges brought about by technological change from 1970 until the early 2000s, at the end of the dot-com boom."

It consists of two sub-datasets:\r 1.\tThe first sub-dataset contains information on the various political initiatives that were undertaken in these political entities to address the challenges posed by digital change in education. \r 2.\tThe second sub-dataset includes information on the actors and platforms that played a role in the framing of these initiatives.\r Together, these two sub-datasets aim to provide an overview of the political initiatives and actors involved in addressing the challenges of digital change in education in Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, and the EC/EU. The database can be used to analyse and compare the different approaches taken by these political entities and to identify key stakeholders."
